# Practice Exercises

This repository contains a collection of practice exercises for the extra class. The exercises are designed to help you improve your skills in programming, DevOps, and data science.

## Structure

The repository is organized into three directories:

- `exercises`: Contains the original exercises for each topic.
- `student-solutions`: Contains solutions submitted by students.
- `exercise-solutions`: Contains the official solutions for each exercise.

Each directory is organized into subdirectories for each topic. The subdirectories and their contents are as follows:

- `programming`: Exercises for practicing programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, design patterns, and algorithms.
- `devops`: Exercises for practicing DevOps techniques such as Docker, Kubernetes, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).
- `data-science`: Exercises for practicing data science techniques such as natural language processing, machine learning, and chatbot development.

Each exercise is contained in a separate file with a descriptive name. The files are formatted as Jupyter Notebooks, which allow you to run and modify the code directly in your browser.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/lnhchau/practice-exercises.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, you can navigate to the `exercises` directory and open the Jupyter Notebook for the exercise you want to work on.
